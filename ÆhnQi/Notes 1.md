VERY EARLY THOUGHTS:

__________________________

Mutagen

Graft 

Herbs plants resources etc have DNA

Randomly generated plants where genes are set

  

Alchemy:

Taking GenomeA + GenomeB

  

ResultTable takes DNA produces result

So type Plant + Plant : determine Type 

Output Type result has mixed genetics and

Can go through result table

Consume( Serum/Potion dna )

 => EffectSequence

ABC

CCB DNA

ABA

=>

AILMENT CHANCE %: Run same DNA

  Chance of Bleed: +1% -2%

  Chance to ignite: -0.0032%

  Chance to freeze: +13.01%

Dominant Ailment: Freeze(13%)

Duration: DNA => Number

STATS:

 Movespeed: +8%

  

Genetic algorithm ?

Core in every region

Region is an area of the world

Each region is a lobby

  

The lobby list will essentially be a world population map

  

The World Core is Region 

  

KARMA

The karma system is what operates a person's ability to maintain value over deaths/development cycles during testing. Each steamid will have associated data for:

  

Player: Ehntae

Karma: 588,672

    [Darkness Cleared]

         Monsters Banished: 574,926

         Cores Restored: 14

         Deaths: 18

Total: +...

    [Deeds]

Etc

  

Karma will affect initial genetics/data for each cultivator created. As cultivators die this allows users to not restart each time 

  

Eventually the karma system can be used to specifically alter the starting stats and data of a newly born cultivator. 

  

Each cultivator uses the model for s&box. They begin at minimum scale and will end up at their eventual target height determined by their height gene.

  

Height will be HeightGene * (age/20years)

  

  

  

Each region contains a Core. 

World Core can hold infinite Qi. 

Any given region can have Core with x/max Qi.

  

  

  

  

  

  

A core can be guarded and given Qi by players to increase its life 

  

(SECT benefits)

Every morning the Core restores and distributes!!! Qi based on its tap %

A sect can take control of a core to control its tap

This means players will want to play in regions with higher Qi as they will have more to absorb

Passive Qi in the day has both Quality & Density

The density is usually highest at the core where it releases

  

TALISMAN

[ ] Item which can hold spell(s) must have enough Qi to cast

[ ] Used to remotely cast or cannons/weapons cast techniques

  

  

SHIPS

[ ] Grid for placing structures on the ship

[ ] Large cube blocks for ship hull

[ ] Start basic movement no physics

[ ] Use a controller to emulate movement on water whilst turning etc

[ ] Sail x2 set to open will generate push etc

  

[ ] Cast cannon which fires talismans 

[ ] Casting turret which casts talismans (which are usually ranged)

[ ] Allow for boarding other ships simply by jumping onto them

[ ] Maybe use physics to weld the player to the ship

[ ] Maybe apply small forces based on ship rocking and pitching. And sudden stops

[ ] 

  

ORIGINS LORE____________________________________

  

DARKNESS comes from the oceans

And enemies can spawn and attack from ocean

Players cannot swim must use ships

  

Cultivators will roam the island (region) where a core is during the day for free Qi refill and protection

Out at Sea beyond the island

[ ] Ship can be used to reach x distance until another island is reached
